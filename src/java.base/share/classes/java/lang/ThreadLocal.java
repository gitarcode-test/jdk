 * copy of the variable.  {@code ThreadLocal} instances are typically private
 * static fields in classes that wish to associate state with a thread (e.g.,
 * a user ID or Transaction ID).
 *
 * <p>For example, the class below generates unique identifiers local to each
 * thread.
 * A thread's id is assigned the first time it invokes {@code ThreadId.get()}
 * and remains unchanged on subsequent calls.
