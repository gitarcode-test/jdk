 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jvmti/scenarios/hotswap/HS301/hs301t002.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [quick, jpda, jvmti, noras, redefine, feature_hotswap]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * Description ::
 *     This testcase uses jvmti->RedefineClasses(... ), RedefineClasses(... ) should fail
 *     to change method modifiers.
 *     The Test will creates an instance of a class ./MyClass.java. After few steps, JVMTIEnv will attempt
 *     to redefine it to ./newclass00/MyClass.java. One of the MyClass's method in ./newclass00/MyClass.java
 *     has a static modifier.  Because Redefine doesn't accept method's modifiers changes, the test is
 *     supposed to fail to redefine the class.
 *     The testcase is said to pass, if jvmti->RedefineClasses(... ) call fails.
